## Coding Challenge
### sensory bingo

### `rules`
- [ ]  A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- [ ]  There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
- [ ]  You can have multiple bingos
- [ ]  Build a fully working Bingo App using ReactJS **respecting the 3 basic rules explained above**.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `task`
- [ ]  The game **must** always fit nicely to any screen-size (e.g. mobile).
- [ ]  **Design your own version** – our game is an example. Be creative and pick your own design!
- [ ]  Having a bingo requires some **nice visual reward**. You don't need to use confetti – choose something you believe fits best.
- [ ]  Think of multiple gamers playing the Bingo together.. ensure that winning the game is possible and fair. (hint: if every player has the same card, everybody would win)
- [ ]  **Add something new.** Come up with something you would enjoy while playing the game.


## things I would've done (with more time)
- added sound effects for clicking on bingo boxes
- made the UI more responsive + dynamic
- added a better visual reward than just an alert
- implement my test cases
- implement bingo-instructions component for the right side of the page
